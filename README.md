## How much time you spent on this assignment and what you did/didn't like?
It took me almost 5 days to fully complete the rendering.

## What would you have done differently if you had had more time?
If I had more time, I would have configured user access differently so that they could or could not perform actions on objects that do not belong to them (projects, tasks)

## With which parts of your application are you satisfied?
I am satisfied with the project architecture, as it separates the core business from the Framework, thus facilitating migration. But I am also satisfied with the security of my APIs, particularly with the verification of the user making the requests.

## Which parts would need improvement?
There should be an improvement at the task level. It would be necessary to change the status of a task when starting or stopping the timer for a task. It will also be necessary to allow each user to see all projects and tasks, without being able to modify them.
